                    <p>This club is a technical club that is apart of my college. It is called NOBE, which is an acronym for the official title of 
                        National Organization of Business and Engineering.
                        I figured that this would be the perfect club for me because it gave me an opportunity to learn more about web development. I have
                        always developed many mobile projects, and figured that I should expand my knowledge about overall development as a whole. The project that we did
                        for this club was to create a website that mimics what an ecommerce website acts like. Using different technologies and languages such as
                        Node.js, HTML/CSS, EJS, and a Stripe API, I created a website that had many contents associated with it such as basketball tickets, various 
                        shopping items, and an overall shopping cart in which users can check out their purchased items and a payment system would be leveraged through
                        Stripe (all in test mode, so user data was not being tracked in any way).
