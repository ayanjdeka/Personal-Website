                    <p>So far, my experience at Tinder has been amazing. It is my first internship, so at first it was a little nerve wracking. To be more specific
                    on what I do, I am part of the Discovery team for the Android application. What this team does is that they take part in any of the events
                    that happen before the actual match happens. What I have done so far in the first month of my internship is create an online label, in which
                    users can see if other users are online currently in the app. I had to develop this project applying MVVM architecture, Kotlin's coroutine flows,
                    and the framework of Dagger 2. In addition to this, I have learned many of the tools that enterprise technology companies use, such as Github,
                    the different workflows that are implemented when engineers push code, Flipper, and Jira Ticketing. Overall, I am excited for the next two months
                    in my internship!!</p>
