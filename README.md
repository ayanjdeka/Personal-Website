# Personal Website
This is my personal website, which was made utilizing the framework of Bootstrap. As for the overview of the technology implemented in the website, it first starts with the animations. 
Many of the animations that are within the website are developed entirely from HTML and CSS. Additionally, I learned the basics of JQuery and included the library to
implement a scrolling affect that my website does with the navigation bar at the top of the site. I also decided to develop extra features within the site, such as the ability
to play the guitar and to play a mini basketball game. To build the guitar and also implement the functionality of it, I learned the basics of SVG files and working sounds and animations
with JavaScript, and developed this to have a playable virtual guitar on my website. As for the basketball game, I utilized Phaser.js as the game framework for this game.
Overall, I hope you love the website, and it can be accessed through the link www.ayandeka.com!
